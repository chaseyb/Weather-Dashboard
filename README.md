A simple weather dashboard application, that shows you the current weather and 5 day forecast of whatever city the user inputs.

# Functionality

When the page is loaded it doesn't display any weather inforamtion. When the user searches for a city it shows the current weather for that city, and a followinhg 5 day forecast for it as well. After the user inputs a city, it is saved into a search history. I added a red trash button that deletes the local search historhy based on the previous searches. When the page is reloaded it will display the local search history until the user hits the red trash button.
